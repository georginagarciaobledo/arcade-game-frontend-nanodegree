frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is a game that I created for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It is based on "classic `arcade game" called "Frogger."

Instructions: 
1. How to run the game: 
	Go to https://georginagarciaobledo.github.io/arcade-game-frontend-nanodegree/
2. How to play the game: 
	You are the bug. Your goal to make it to the water without encountering a human. Humans are afraid of you, so they will shoo you back to your starting place if you touch them. Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to avoid the fearful humans and get to the sparkling water. See how quickly you can quench your thirst.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
